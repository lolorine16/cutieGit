# CutieGit TODO List

## additional ideas

âœ¨ You can go even further:

- [ ] **Add interactive navigation** - Add an interactive (select) option to navigate through cloned files
- [ ] **Help mode** - Add a CutieGit.sh --help mode
- [x] **ASCII Logo** - Create a small CUTIE GIT logo and flower footer
- [ ] **Zip mode** - Add a small zip mode: CutieGit -z to create a .zip archive with just the file
- [ ] **Deletion logs** - Add deletion logs to see what has been removed
